# Supervisor Agent Guide

The Supervisor Agent is a core component of the Agent Management Server (AMS) that orchestrates the collaboration between different agents. This document explains how the Supervisor works and how it can be customized for different use cases.

## Overview

The Supervisor Agent serves as the "control plane" of AMS, similar to how Kubernetes manages containers. It performs several critical functions:

1. **Task Analysis**: Analyzes incoming tasks to determine required capabilities
2. **Agent Selection**: Selects appropriate agents based on task requirements
3. **Collaboration Management**: Coordinates the interaction between selected agents
4. **Execution Flow**: Determines the order in which agents should contribute
5. **Message Routing**: Ensures messages are delivered to the right agents

## Supervisor Architecture

The Supervisor Agent consists of several components:

### 1. Task Analyzer

The Task Analyzer component uses LLM-based analysis to understand what a task requires:

```python
class TaskAnalyzer:
    async def analyze_task(self, task: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Analyze the task to determine required capabilities, complexity, etc.
        
        Returns:
            Dict containing analysis results including:
            - required_capabilities: List of capabilities needed
            - task_type: Classification of the task
            - complexity: Estimated complexity score
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Agent Selector

The Agent Selector component chooses which agents should collaborate on a task:

```python
class AgentSelector:
    async def select_agents(self, task_analysis: Dict[str, Any], available_agents: List[AgentMetadata]) -> List[AgentMetadata]:
        """
        Select the best agents for a task based on the task analysis.
        
        Returns:
            List of agent metadata objects for selected agents
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Collaboration Manager

The Collaboration Manager component handles the coordination of agent interactions:

```python
class CollaborationManager:
    async def determine_execution_order(self, selected_agents: List[AgentMetadata], task_analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[AgentMetadata]:
        """
        Determine the order in which agents should execute.
        
        Returns:
            Ordered list of agent metadata objects
        """
        # Implementation details...
        
    async def create_collaboration_session(self, agents: List[AgentMetadata], task: str) -> CollaborationSession:
        """
        Create a new collaboration session for the selected agents.
        
        Returns:
            CollaborationSession object with session details
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 4. Message Router

The Message Router component ensures messages are delivered appropriately:

```python
class MessageRouter:
    async def route_message(self, message: Message, session: CollaborationSession) -> None:
        """
        Route a message to the appropriate agent(s) in a session.
        """
        # Implementation details...
        
    async def broadcast_message(self, message: Message, session: CollaborationSession) -> None:
        """
        Broadcast a message to all agents in a session.
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

## How the Supervisor Works

When a task is submitted to AMS, the Supervisor follows these steps:

### 1. Task Analysis Phase

```
User submits task → Task Analyzer processes the task → Task requirements are identified
```

The Supervisor Agent analyzes the task to determine:
- What capabilities are required
- The domain of the task (e.g., coding, creative writing, research)
- The complexity and expected skills needed

Example analysis:

```json
{
  "task": "Create a Python data visualization dashboard for sales data",
  "required_capabilities": ["code_generation", "data_analysis", "data_visualization"],
  "domain": "software_development",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "expected_output": "working_code"
}
```

### 2. Agent Selection Phase

```
Task analysis → Agent Selector queries registry → Best-matching agents are selected
```

The Supervisor queries the Agent Registry to find agents with capabilities matching the task requirements. It considers:
- Capability match scores
- Agent specialization
- Past performance on similar tasks
- Default preferences set by the system administrator

### 3. Collaboration Planning Phase

```
Selected agents → Collaboration Manager determines execution order → Session is created
```

The Supervisor creates a plan for how agents should collaborate:
- Sequential execution for tasks with clear dependencies
- Parallel execution for independent subtasks
- Combination of both for complex workflows

It also respects explicit execution priorities and dependencies specified in agent configurations:

```json
"config": {
  "execution_priority": 2,
  "depends_on": ["ResearchAgent"]
}
```

### 4. Execution Phase

```
Execution plan → Message Router facilitates communication → Agents execute task
```

The Supervisor starts the execution by:
1. Sending initial task instructions to the first agent(s)
2. Routing messages between agents based on the execution plan
3. Managing transitions between different agent contributions
4. Handling errors or unexpected situations

## Customizing the Supervisor

The Supervisor's behavior can be customized in several ways:

### Execution Strategies

AMS supports different execution strategies that can be configured:

#### 1. Sequential Execution

Agents execute one after another in a specified order:

```python
execution_config = {
    "strategy": "sequential",
    "order": [
        {"agent_id": "agent1", "mode": "analyze"},
        {"agent_id": "agent2", "mode": "implement"},
        {"agent_id": "agent3", "mode": "review"}
    ]
}
```

#### 2. Parallel Execution

Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of the task:

```python
execution_config = {
    "strategy": "parallel",
    "groups": [
        {"agent_ids": ["researcher1", "researcher2"], "topic": "market analysis"},
        {"agent_ids": ["developer1", "developer2"], "topic": "implementation"}
    ],
    "synchronization_points": ["after_research"]
}
```

#### 3. Dynamic Workflow

The execution order is determined during runtime based on agent outputs:

```python
execution_config = {
    "strategy": "dynamic",
    "decision_agent": "workflow_manager",
    "possible_paths": {
        "path1": ["agent1", "agent2", "agent4"],
        "path2": ["agent1", "agent3", "agent4"]
    }
}
```

### Custom Agent Selection Logic

You can implement custom agent selection logic by extending the `AgentSelector` class:

```python
class DomainSpecificAgentSelector(AgentSelector):
    async def select_agents(self, task_analysis: Dict[str, Any], available_agents: List[AgentMetadata]) -> List[AgentMetadata]:
        # Custom selection logic for specific domains
        domain = task_analysis.get("domain", "general")
        
        if domain == "healthcare":
            return self._select_healthcare_agents(task_analysis, available_agents)
        elif domain == "finance":
            return self._select_finance_agents(task_analysis, available_agents)
        else:
            # Fall back to default selection for other domains
            return await super().select_agents(task_analysis, available_agents)
```

### Custom Collaboration Rules

You can define custom collaboration patterns by implementing a `CollaborationRuleEngine`:

```python
class CustomCollaborationRules(CollaborationRuleEngine):
    async def apply_rules(self, agents: List[AgentMetadata], task: str) -> CollaborationPlan:
        # Apply custom rules to create a collaboration plan
        plan = CollaborationPlan()
        
        # Add custom logic, for example:
        # - Always include a validator agent at the end
        # - Ensure domain experts collaborate on complex tasks
        # - Apply special rules for specific task types
        
        return plan
```

## Advanced Supervisor Features

### 1. Feedback Loops

The Supervisor can implement feedback loops where agents review and improve each other's work:

```python
feedback_loop_config = {
    "enabled": True,
    "max_iterations": 3,
    "improvement_threshold": 0.8,
    "reviewers": ["editor_agent", "quality_checker_agent"]
}
```

### 2. Task Decomposition

For complex tasks, the Supervisor can break them down into subtasks:

```python
decomposition_config = {
    "enabled": True,
    "strategy": "hierarchical",
    "max_depth": 2,
    "planner_agent": "task_decomposer"
}
```

The planner agent creates a task tree, and the Supervisor manages execution of the entire tree.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop

The Supervisor can involve human users at specific points in the workflow:

```python
human_interaction_config = {
    "checkpoints": ["after_planning", "before_final_submission"],
    "timeout_seconds": 3600,
    "default_action_on_timeout": "proceed"
}
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring

The Supervisor tracks agent performance to improve future agent selection:

```python
monitoring_config = {
    "track_metrics": true,
    "performance_indicators": ["response_time", "output_quality", "task_success_rate"],
    "feedback_collection": "enabled"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Definition

To get the best results from the Supervisor:

- Be specific about task requirements
- Include expected output format
- Specify any constraints or preferences
- Provide relevant context and information

Example of a well-defined task:

```json
{
  "task": "Create a data visualization dashboard for our Q2 sales data",
  "expected_output": "A Python dashboard using Plotly and Dash",
  "context": "The dashboard will be used by the sales team to track performance",
  "data_source": "Q2_sales_data.csv",
  "preferences": {
    "visualization_style": "corporate",
    "include_filters": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Agent Design

Design agents that work well with the Supervisor:

- Give agents clear, focused capabilities
- Use descriptive names and capabilities
- Include detailed configuration options
- Design complementary agent teams

### 3. Execution Configuration

Configure execution for optimal collaboration:

- Use execution priorities for clear dependencies
- Group related agents in parallel execution
- Include validation agents to ensure quality
- Set appropriate timeouts and error handling

## Conclusion

The Supervisor Agent is the orchestration engine that makes AMS powerful for complex tasks. By understanding how it works and how to customize it, you can create sophisticated agent collaboration workflows tailored to your specific needs.
